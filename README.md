# IM-Net-ShapeTalkPretraining

This page is a duplicate of the [original IMNet pytorch implementation](https://github.com/czq142857/IM-NET-pytorch),
with some additional functionality that facilitates the retraining and data preprocessing for the ShapeTalk dataset.

It also supports the serialization of trained models so that they can be used for downstream inference tasks. This generally
should enable you to use your own virtual environments during inference, and our virtual environment during training.
